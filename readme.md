To setup the project:

   1. Create a virtual environment with a Python 3.8 executable.
   2. Activate the virtual environment.
   3. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install dependencies.
   4. Download and install [OpenRefine](https://openrefine.org/download.html) according to your OS.
   5. Upload the data file to the project directory.
   6. Run `python main.py` to run the project and follow the prompts.
